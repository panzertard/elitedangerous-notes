> "the kind of stories I like to write and the kind of stories I like to read, which are
adventure stories. This results a lot of action normally, but it's primarely the journey, the mystery, problemsolving, escaping and surviving.  
Turning the tables and come to victory. That's what drives my stories."

> So that's, I guess that comes down to conflict really. The way I like to show that is getting _'into the real'(?)_, _'getting to the hits'(?)_ of the point of your characters.   
So I don't mean first person, I call it tight third person point of view where I really
show home that people thinking and what they're thinking using fresh language to really
drive the emotion so that you're driven along the journey with the character, and you feel
their ups and you feel their downs.  

> It's a **journey** for the reader as well as the character.  



## John Harper's video #2 and statement
Ref: <https://youtu.be/mb8c2wB50QI?t=54>  
> "And of course we have INRA the Intergalactic Naval Research Arm, once a hidden
superpower and now disbanded and gone ... 'oficially'" (wink-wink).  

**Note**: He said "_Research Arm_", not "Reserve Arm". Most likely a tiny blooper, like we all do regarding their name.

Ref: <https://youtu.be/mb8c2wB50QI?t=111>  
> "INRA, officially disbanded but you can bet it's still there in the shadows.
The group known as the 'Elite' probably always been there, perhaps quietly in the past
but now they're coming into the fore.
The Dark Wheel, again they're the Raxxla hunters, they've always been there but now
they're coming out to the fore as well. I'm not sure if anywone picked it up but 
my title is a homeage to group known as The Dark Wheel"

> "And there's Raxxla itself, the mystery, who's rumours and sightings seem to ebb and flow on a 50 year cycle and we're approaching that 50-year peak 
so hearing a lot more sightnings and a lot more mystery around Raxxla."

And the final words:
> "And remember, March 2014 the Legend returns."


## John Harper explains that some of his use of Raxxla had to be redacted.
