### Trojan in Pleiades Sector LS-T c3-12 
There was a [Trojan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_(celestial_body)) found here back in 2017-08-06. The system had been mapped previously, but it was at this stage a commander from Canonn `#chat_science` realized what was going on.  
A trojan has very specific characteristics. L1-L3 are in line, but are considered unstable for long term orbits and cant be sustained. L4-L5 are 60° offset and consider stable positions.

The `Pleiades Sector LS-T c3-12 1` and `Pleiades Sector LS-T c3-12 2` is at a perfect 935.40ls distance and 60° separation.
