# Black Flight
I just picked on some things I didn't know. `[Mod] Node` dumped a bit of info over at Canonn Discord.  

> All this being said, we're pretty sure there's more to find in the Pleiades and those sites, have you ever taken an interest in Black Flight and HIP 22460?  

> It's in a permit locked system, HIP 22460, and it's been locked since the TSS' existed. We know what's inside because some people have had the maps pre lock, and that whole FC fiasco a while back.  

> In there now is a Megaship called "Overlook" landable (it comes up on the map) and it arrived there the same moment as the update.  
It's been years since the lock and no way in has been found  

> Overlook is the HQ of the shadow organisation **"Black Flight"**, a military group responsible for a lot of the pre-Thargoid coverups  
We know this because of the Installation in **Celaneo**, PSJ-17, which was under their control until recently  
The megaship is under "control" of Pleiades Resource Enterprise  

> anyway, theres actually only one place* to solidly find them now
and thats the convoy beacon in **Nommai**, which rotates 3 scenarios of **Black Flight** ships
