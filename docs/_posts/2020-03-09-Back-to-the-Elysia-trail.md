# Plutarch and the allegorical Plato
A few articles made me realize I may have missed a few bits of knowledge. 
As I was following material from [Myth Of Er](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_Er) passing by the [Allegorical interpretations of Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegorical_interpretations_of_Plato) and the different camps of allegorical interpretation.
I realized it was a bit much to soak in this evening.  

However, nearby on of the articles a familiar reference emerged again. 
> The routine attribution of hidden meanings to Plato among Middle Platonists can be found, for example, in Plutarch (c. 45 â€“ 125 CE), a priest of the Elysian mysteries and perhaps a Platonic successor  

Now this is a path many has visited previously, but I wanted to see of something more obvious occurs this time. I know others have been active on this path of Elysia (Elyssia Fields), but I want to discover it my own way.

From my [notes](./notes/Plato-Plutarch-Elysia):  

System | Sol LY | Translation / meaning | Stations / notes
---    | :---:  | --                   | ---
[Plutarch](https://eddb.io/system/15640)  | 38.49 | | [Plutarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch), known primarily for his [Parallel Lives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_Lives) and [Moralia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moralia)
[Elysia](https://eddb.io/system/4539) | 160.43 | | Elysian Fields, also called [Elysium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elysium), are the final resting place of the souls of the heroic and the virtuous in Greek mythology and religion
[Tartarus](https://eddb.io/system/17469) | 132.49 | | ([In Elysium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elysium)) Virgil describes those who will travel to [Elysium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elysium), and those who will travel to [Tartarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartarus)

Time to go flying since I haven't visited neither Plutarch nor Tartarus yet. I have been to Elysia.  

## Plutarch
Arriving in **Plutarch**, the first ship I see is a unnamed Type-7 ship piloted by an NPC named [Azathoth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azathoth). Lovecraft again.  
The ship flies quite oddly at **2c constantly** away from the star for about 4-5 minutes. I have to throttle down to stay behind it. At this stage another NPC Vulture appears from nowhere and tries to interdict it. `Azathoth` wins the interdiction and now heads off in a random direction towards the planets. I did not follow it further.

### Another loitering NPC
Just as I was cruising again another unnamed ship of Type-7, piloted by `Trygg` behaved in the same manner. Flying at 1c in certain directions, slowing down and turning, then back to 1-2c constant speed. He was above and out of the shipping lanes when he was doing this. 
I followed for 14-15 minutes, this time no interdiction occurred.  

Possibly a bug. I suspect the NPC may try to reach a non-existing USS, it has not detected that the USS have despawned. I'll keep an eye out for this later in the next systems.

## Tartarus
Unremarkable quiet and dull.  

## Nysa
`Spirit` Python this time (Shields of Justice) show up on jump-in. We know about this variant, however it seems to be quite easy to trigger Spirit this system. Flies towards `C`. Who knows, there may be something more behind this event. Have to investigate more later again.  
Note, some factions are at war.

Flew to Midwinter Base before turning around and flying to deep space.
