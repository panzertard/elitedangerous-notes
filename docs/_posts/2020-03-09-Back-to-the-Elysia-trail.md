# Plutarch and the allegorical Plato
A few articles made me realize I may have missed a few bits of knowledge. 
As I was following material from [Myth Of Er](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_Er) passing by the [Allegorical interpretations of Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegorical_interpretations_of_Plato) and the different camps of allegorical interpretation.
I realized it was a bit much to soak in this evening.  

However, nearby on of the articles a familiar reference emerged again. 
> The routine attribution of hidden meanings to Plato among Middle Platonists can be found, for example, in Plutarch (c. 45 â€“ 125 CE), a priest of the Elysian mysteries and perhaps a Platonic successor  

Now this is a path many has visited previously, but I wanted to see of something more obvious occurs this time. I know others have been active on this path of Elysia (Elyssia Fields), but I want to discover it my own way.

From my [notes](./notes/Plato-Plutarch-Elysia):  

System | Sol LY | Translation / meaning | Stations / notes
---    | :---:  | --                   | ---
[Plutarch](https://eddb.io/system/15640)  | 38.49 | | [Plutarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch), known primarily for his [Parallel Lives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_Lives) and [Moralia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moralia)
[Elysia](https://eddb.io/system/4539) | 160.43 | | Elysian Fields, also called [Elysium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elysium), are the final resting place of the souls of the heroic and the virtuous in Greek mythology and religion
[Tartarus](https://eddb.io/system/17469) | 132.49 | | ([In Elysium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elysium)) Virgil describes those who will travel to [Elysium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elysium), and those who will travel to [Tartarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartarus)

Time to go flying since I haven't visited neither Plutarch nor Tartarus yet. I have been to Elysia.
