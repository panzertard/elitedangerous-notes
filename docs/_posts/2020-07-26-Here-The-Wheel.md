_(Gap in the story here; how Robert has the memory as a child being part of his mothers burial, knowing where it is, but then can't find her on this planet. It was never explained how he was there at the ceremony while the grave wasn't there. Truly nothing explaining how he has this incorrect and vivid memory. How do you mistake an entire planet and a system?)_
