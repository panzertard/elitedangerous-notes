Jeffress's Second Treasure Hunt : <https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/jeffresss-second-treasure-hunt.195954/>  
PRIZE: 10 M CR, Anaconda painted gold  
[Winner](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/jeffresss-second-treasure-hunt.195954/post-3028813) : CMDR woodhouse

```
Last month, the reclusive philanthropist Alfred Jeffress made headlines with his galaxy-wide treasure hunt, and now it seems the eccentric billionaire is at it again. Having promised that the first event would not be the last of its kind, Jeffress has announced a second treasure hunt, and once again he is offering a share of his vast personal fortune to the winner.

According to a statement from Jeffress, the event will follow much the same format as the first. A mystery object has been placed somewhere in space, and the first person to find and deliver it to a specified location will win the competition. As before, Jeffress has released a riddle that he claims will lead participants to the mystery object:

"A dissatisfied scholar keeps a visionary in his grasp as he makes his deal."
```
> "A dissatisfied scholar keeps a visionary in his grasp as he makes his deal."

```
"dissatisfied scholar"
```
```
If you look up dissatisfied scholars in google the first relevant thing that pops up relates to someone named Faust.
```
```
First part solved.
Faust 68 - slipher hub
```
```
I was narrowed down to FAUST 2688 - Lousma Orbital and Faust 68 - Slipher Hub just because Jack Lousma was an astronaut on Skylab, and the Slipher brothers are notable astronomers that fit the "visionaries" clue very well
```
FAUST 68 Herald:  
> _He sits at the mouth of the fish and writes of water viewed on a long journey with a friend with a twist_

```
wild guess - Formalhaut, Dickensport?
```
```
Beta Piscium, traditional name is Fum al Samakah which means "mouth of the fish"
I'm there now and there's... not here
```
```
Fomalhaut-ensport
```
CG at Dickensport, Fomalhaut:  
> _Times resting place is told for us to hear a rapturous kiss. To cure his ulcer my horse must take a journey so I will need to use aurochs to plow the fields today, it needs to be done for we need to eat before our lands are taken possession of by the sun._  

> Return object.  

```
"Times Resting Place" should refer to a system in the Pleiades Nebula as it's referred to as the "cradle of time" or the "Herd of time-keepers"

You are forgetting the horse...
```
```
I keep looking at the clue and thinking about how strangely it's written. It seems very unnatural, and looks more like a code to me than an actual riddle. I've tried taking the first letter of each word and seeing if something can be rearranged and decoded, but no success yet. The first sentence is **TRPITFUTHARK**, which caught my eye because **FUTHARK** is a real system. I scoured FUTHARK last night and didn't find any static instances. Maybe one of the code breakers can find something.
```
```
If you are on to something here.. "Times resting place is told for us to hear a rapturous kiss. To....."

So "times " a clue to the item to be found, maybe like antique clock? and it's resting place is F.U.T.H.A.R.K.
```
```
Not sure if anyone here has mentioned this, but a guy on Steam has got a theory: http://steamcommunity.com/app/359320/discussions/0/490124466462527531/
```
```
My guess was ATLAS
```
```
FUTHARK... The name of the Runic alphabet and the first 6 runes (TH are combined)...

The U (2nd rune) was used in the literal sense for....Aurochs !!

```
There's a lot more in the wikipedia article about the Elder Futhark runes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_Futhark)

journey
sun
ulcer
need
horse

Anyway, who's going to try blowing up the Evidence Storage T9?
```
```
Also, this week in Epic Red Herrings: "his ulcer" is an anagram for Herculis. Unbelievable
```
```

    > cant participate but should ve been "Cernunnos"

Yup.

Sold the **Time Capsule** I found at **Cernunnos 3** at **Fomalhaut** / ensport:
```

```
The first letters of the words making up the first sentence are **TRPITFUTHARK**. Futhark, as well as being a system name, is an old system of runes.
The runes translate to a single letter, but also to a word/phrase. Some of the relevant words (e.g. _"ulcer", "horse", "aurochs"_) appear in the following sentences. **If you find the relevant runes and use the associated letter instead of the word for each time such a word appears, it spells Cernunnos**.
```
