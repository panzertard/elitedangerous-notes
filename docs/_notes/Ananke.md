#### Catasterismi
> Catasterismi (Greek Καταστερισμοί Katasterismoi, "placings among the stars") is an Alexandrian prose retelling of the mythic origins of stars and constellations, as they were interpreted in Hellenistic culture.

#### Vagabond, Wanderer
>  In Classical Greece, the **"wandering stars"** and the gods who directed them were separate entities, as for Plato; in Hellenistic culture, the association became an inseparable identification, so that Apollo, no longer the regent of the Sun, actually was Helios (Seznec 1981, pp 37–40).  


## Sizable names in this context
These systems can be visited in Elite.  

#### Hipparchus  

> Hipparchus is considered to have been among the most important Greek astronomers, because he introduced the concept of exact prediction into astronomy. He was also the last innovative astronomer before Claudius Ptolemy, a mathematician who worked at Alexandria in Roman Egypt in the 2nd century.

Also its been so long I had forgotten about [The Grand Sirius Interstellar Expedition](https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/23-FEB-3301) back in 3301.... which had us turning in exploration data and ended up in the wonders of Robigo Sothis and Ceos. Both Robigo and Sothis are gods similar to Hecate and related to Sirius. Ceos was a greek Island where they worshiped the star Sirius
