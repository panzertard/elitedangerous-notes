# The dog stars

The name [Procyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procyon) comes from the Ancient Greek Προκύων (Prokyon), meaning "before the dog", since it precedes the "Dog Star" [Sirius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius) as it travels across the sky due to Earth's rotation.  
(_Although Procyon has a greater right ascension_, it also has a more northerly declination, which means it will rise above the horizon earlier than Sirius from most northerly latitudes.) In Greek mythology, Procyon is associated with Maera, a hound belonging to Erigone, daughter of Icarius of Athens.

### Marduk
> The two dog stars are referred to in the most ancient literature and were venerated by the Babylonians and the Egyptians, In Babylonian mythology, Procyon was known as Nangar (the Carpenter), an aspect of **[Marduk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marduk)**, involved in constructing and organising the celestial sky. [[34](https://books.google.no/books?id=ILBuYcGASxcC&pg=PA217&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)]

The name Marduk was probably pronounced Marutuk.[3] The etymology of the name Marduk is conjectured as derived from **amar-Utu** ("immortal son of Utu" or "bull calf of the sun god Utu").[2] The origin of Marduk's name may reflect an earlier genealogy, or have had cultural ties to the ancient city of **Sippar** (whose god was Utu), dating to the third millennium BC.[4]

By the Hammurabi period, Marduk had become astrologically associated with the planet **Jupiter**.[5]

> 7.1.2 Marduk and the Frame of Heaven
Marduk, the great god equated with Jupiter, tells in the Era-Epos of a flood and the heavens awry:  
When I stood up from my seat and let the flood break in, then the judgement of Earth and Heaven went our of joint...  
The gods, which trembled, the stars of heaven - Their position changed, and I did not bring them back.  
(Santillana and Dechend 1969 p. 325, following P.F. Gössman.)  

> However, Marduk is also Nangar, The Carpenter (equated in turn with Procyon), and is the measurer and builder who rebuilt the heavens and established astronomical order:  
He constructed stations for the great gods,  
Fixing their astral likeness as constellations  
He determined the year by designating the zones:  
He set up three constellations for each of the twelve months  
After defining the days of the year (by means) of (heavenly) figures,   
He founded the station of Nebiru to determine their (heavenly) bands,   
That none might transgress or fall short.  
Alongside he set up the stations of Enlil and Ea.

... translations of Jupiter, which reads:  
Marduk is Umunpauddu at it's appearance; when it has risen for two (or four?) hours it becomes Sagmigar; when it stands in the meridian it becomes Nibiru
