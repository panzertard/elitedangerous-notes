O'Brien Vision, orbiting Lucifer, Sirius:

```
Sirius B and Procyon B are considered the pups of Sirius the Dog star  
```
```
3 wolf cubs = 3 T-tauri stars?  
```
```
"Where no power resides" suggests it's outside the bubble  
"follow the great dogs wolf pack as they rise up to where no power resides" - somewhere outside the bubble maybe lupus constellation?  
"Three cubs watch over me with fiery intent" - Three stars maybe young stars?  
"yet either the elder nor younger know my lupine secret" - not the youngest or oldest star?  
```
```
Do you now, that Mirzam is part of Canis Majoris and is called "the announcer", as it rises a few minutes before Sirius  
```
```
- nothing at Adara, Wezen, Mirzam, Nu-1/2/3 Canis Majoris (all part of the Canis Majoris constellation)
- nothing at Alcor (that was the last star from the lead of '3 cubs of Ursa Majoris')

I found the treasure at Wolf 529. It was on the ring around Wolf 529 B4.

USS with 3 antique jewelery. I went to the bulletin board at O'Brien Vision and there was no indication that they were the treasure.
So I sold them at the black market.

I only realised it was the goal after I undocked. 
```
**Antique Jewelry**
```
Been there 5 minutes ago: it is a very particular USS in fact, and it is still there
I got the Antique Jewelry as well, as a Souvenir
```
```
The treasure was "Antique Artefacts"?
Actually yeah, it might have been "Antique Jewellery", its been a while
```

Some issues in the riddle itself which have no meaning in the context of the solution. Expect issues like this in any future riddles.  
`cubs`, `with fiery intent`, `lupine`
```
"rise up to where no power resides" - pretty literal (kind of too literal, in fact :p) - outside of the Powerplay bubbles
"three cubs watch over me with fiery intent" - a system with three stars (although where the "cubs" comes from I don't know, unless those stars are young T Tauris)
"neither the elder nor the younger know my lupine secret" - the middle star (although where they got elder and younger from I again don't know, since as far as I know all stars in a system show as the same age on the Galaxy Map)
```
