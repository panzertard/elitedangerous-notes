"Following a long hiatus, reclusive philanthropist Alfred Jeffress has announced a new treasure hunt, and once again he is offering a share of his vast personal fortune to the winner.

In a statement, Jeffress confirmed that the event will follow the same format as his previous treasure hunts. A mystery object has been placed somewhere in space, and the first person to find it and deliver it to a specified location will win the competition. Jeffress has released a riddle that he claims will set participants on the path to finding the mystery object:

"The king's resting place is where I'm hid. Entrusted to a queen, with a spring in her steps."

With such a generous prize on offer, the event is sure to capture the imagination of the galactic community."
```

> "The king's resting place is where I'm hid. Entrusted to a queen, with a spring in her steps.

```
The galnet clue is the stuff of legends and myths.
```
Avalone? Pershephone?  

And roiza solved it:

Winner announced:  
Galnet (`29 MAR 3302`) : <https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/56fa583e9657ba761e38b2c8>  


> The treasure hunt organised by billionaire philanthropist Alfred Jeffress has come to an end, with a pilot by the name of **Commander Oriza** claiming victory. Thousands of people took part in the competition, but ultimately there could only be one victor.  

> As with Jeffress's previous treasure hunts, competitors were required to solve a series of riddles to find the mystery object at the centre of the search â€“ **a relic from Earth's past**. The clues took pilots to **Persephone in the Avalon** system, then to **Arrhenius Terminal in Bard** and finally to the **Algol system**.

> When the winner was announced, Alfred Jeffress released the following statement:

> "I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to the winner. One of my representatives will be in touch soon to give you the details of your prizes. As for the other competitors, I would like to offer my commiserations. But do not despair! There will be another Jeffress treasure hunt, and next time the winner could be you."
