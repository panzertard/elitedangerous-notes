## Princess
[Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_(mythology))

> As a subject, Andromeda has been popular in art since classical times; it is one of several Greek myths of a Greek hero's rescue of the intended victim of an archaic hieros gamos (sacred marriage), giving rise to the "_[princess and dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_and_dragon)"_ motif. From the Renaissance, interest revived in the original story, typically as derived from Ovid's Metamorphoses (4.665ff).  
> all names that refer to Andromeda's role in the Greco-Roman myth of Perseus, in which Cassiopeia, the queen of Ethiopia, bragged that her daughter was more beautiful than the [Nereids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nereid), sea nymphs blessed with incredible beauty  

> After Andromeda's death [Athena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena) placed her in the sky as a constellation, to honor her. Several of the neighboring constellations ([Perseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_(constellation)), [Cassiopeia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_(constellation)), [Cetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetus), and [Cepheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheus_(constellation))) also represent characters in the Perseus myth. It is connected with the constellation Pegasus.  

### Parents
> Andromeda was the daughter of [Cepheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheus,_King_of_Aethiopia) and [Cassiopeia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_(Queen_of_Aethiopia))  

Rather see: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheus_(father_of_Andromeda)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheus_(father_of_Andromeda))  

> In desperation, King Cepheus consulted the oracle of [Ammon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amun)

### Fairytales

[Princess and dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_and_dragon)
> One of the earliest example of the motif comes from the Ancient Greek tale of [Perseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus), who rescued the princess Andromeda from [Cetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetus_(mythology)), a sea monster often described as resembling a serpent or dragon.  

### Nereids

> Nereids are particularly associated with the Aegean Sea, where they dwelt with their father Nereus in the depths within a golden palace. The most notable of them are [Thetis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thetis), wife of Peleus and mother of Achilles; Amphitrite, wife of Poseidon and mother of Triton; and Galatea, the vain love interest of the Cyclops Polyphemus.  

> Their melodious voices sang as they danced around their father.

> when Thetis cries out in sympathy for the _grief_ of Achilles for the slain Patroclus, her sisters appear.  

### Cetus  

[Cetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetus_(mythology))
> Upon consulting a wise oracle, King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia were told to sacrifice Andromeda to Cetus.
