> "Intoxicating vapours, were thought to have been inhaled by the oracle which drifted up, emanated 
from a crack in the ground (rift) where Python / Pytho was slayed by Apollo (coins have been located 
which depict a serpent wound around the Omphalos or sat upon by Apollo)."

> "Using this I took the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies as a reference 
but to what area of the galaxy I don't yet know, the only thing that came to mind straight away 
was the minor faction, Mother Gaia but this theory will need some work.
The next part that stood out to me was the siren of the deepest void. Looking at the galaxy map 
on the codex there are two regions that seem to relate to this, Lyras Song and The Void."
	
> "There are 18 planets in the region, one Earth Type, 1 Ammonia, 2 Water PLanets, 1 Metal Rich, 
2 High MEtal, 2 Rocky NA's, 1 Rocky Ice, 1 Ice NA, 1 Metal Rich with Atmos, 2 High Metals, 
2 Rocky with Atmos, 1 Rocky Ice with Atmos and 1 Ice Planet with Atmos"
