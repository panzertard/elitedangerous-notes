A cluster f of an event. So many issues.  
Prize: Corvette  

<https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/567143df9657ba02506de916>  

#### Another Jeffress Treasure Hunt

Eccentric billionaire Alfred Jeffress has made headlines in recent weeks with not one but two galaxy-wide treasure hunts, each of which saw the reclusive philanthropist give out enormous cash prizes. Now Jeffress has announced a third treasure hunt, and once again he has promised to reward the winner with a share of his vast personal fortune.

The event is expected to follow the same format as the previous two. A mystery object has been placed somewhere in space, and the first person to find and deliver it to a specified location will win the competition. As before, the hunt begins with a riddle, composed by Jeffress, which will lead participants to the mystery object:

> "To win the prize, follow a story of kings, crowns and jewels, not tall tales told by fools. Your quest to restore the king's crown starts in the middle. Travel where all frequencies of light reside to start solving my riddle."

Jeffress has promised that this hunt will be the most challenging yet, having devised even more cryptic clues this time.

How to go so far from the place "where all frequencies of light reside"
```
```
So that thing in Prism has nothing to do with treasure hunt then?...
```
```
1st clue Leads to a system with a station you dock at, at that station you'll receive the 2nd clue from the local news.
```
```
I am of a similar opinion that this is a christmas based hunt.
```
```
Prism has nothing to do with the 2nd clue.
```
```
focus on an eastern translation for middle star 
```
```
Yeah, I'm +- stuck on the same. middlestar/middle does not seem to resolve into any specific star name in Elite's map. Also the aforementioned cnnection to Orion is not resolving into much.

Hmmmmm wait.
I may have just found something whilst typing this post and looking back through.. stuff.
If this is right, then using existing lists instead of google translate might end up working.

Edit: Yep. Onwards to second step.
```
```
First sentence: Not sure what this is about, maybe it's telling us not to look for answers in fiction.
Second sentence: Which system to go to. The earlier hint about language helps but is not needed if you know a lot of constellations or get lucky with the google search terms (like I did).
Third sentence: Which station to go to. 
```
```
The eastern language hint from earlier could be narrowed a bit to "middle eastern middle star". So, what middle eastern language can you think of? Perhaps a google search will return a list of stars in that language, with translations making searching for "middle" not too difficult.
```
```
So I made it to the end last night and 12 others had signed up at the last riddle. Totally stuck!
```
```
I think many people are overthinking the riddles and trying to be too clever. 
I noticed a pattern that the riddles are quite literal once you figure out the story. 

I am on clue #3 since last night and hope to figure out where to go next. I found all my answers in wikipedia if that helps anyone, it seems like a trend of information from one page leading to another with a central "eastern" world theme. 

As others have stated, try looking up for star translations for middle star and go from there. Clue #2 seems pretty deep and somewhat confusing at first, but the answer is so simple I wanted to smack myself in the face when I found out what it was.
```
Middle: Wasat (as sound, Arabic)  
Has a station "White"  

```
Figured out the second riddle. Was trying to be far too clever looking for answers in King Lear and the like.

It was nothing so elaborate. I went back to basics and just thought, 'What do you get in a storm?' A quick goggle on what I found and it kinda made sense.
```

```
Solved riddle 4! I figured that all riddles follow a certain pattern you must follow. If you do.. it's easier than you think. I managed to solve all 4 riddles within two hours including flying to the stations. So it is possible to solve them. Let see of I can solve the last one.
```
```
Aaaargh. Solution to clue #2 is just so... I mean, come on! "Where he takes shelter in a storm" - the system name (X) is NOT even an answer to that! NOBODY uses X as a 'shelter in a storm'. 
```
```
He doesn't take shelter from the storm in that. The <traveller> takes shelter in <system>.
```
```
3rd clue - schoolyard riddle - what type of king has no crown? Then google the arabic for that answer with a tail.
```

```
We all flew through Prism. We took that gem. And we could not sell it to Mentor due to a lack of Black Market. So for FDev to suddenly add in a black market there after the event has started after commanders combed DOZENS of systems, that is very very very unprofessional.
```
```
Can't say I'm too thrilled to find out I was sitting at the CG location with the correct cargo - but there was no way to hand it in at the time.

Not cool, Frontier - not cool at all. 
```
>"find a traveler that was sent to converse with a king where he takes shelter in a storm"
```
Answers - Riddle one - arabic for middle star is Wasat - all frequencies of light = white. White terminal in Wasat.
Riddle 2 - famous arabian traveller was Ahmed Fadlan. Fadlan in Rain (storm = rain)
3 - King with no crown = lion. Lion with a "tale" = tail of the lion. In arabic this is denebola
4 - a trusted advisor is a Mentor
5 - Put aside doubt and return = go to the place you were told that it wasn't to get the thing you were told wasn't the thing = Prism

Galnet Winner statement: <https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/567961539657babc59349a81>
```
I am CMDR Sync Mercy. I delivered the precious jewels first at the station, and the CG for the corvette read 1 ton collected for me and 1 ton collected on total.

But the CG for corvette didn't close right away, and i gave the answer to some on IRC. À CMDR then sold his 5 tons at the station, approx 30 seconds after i sold 1 t. The CG closzd right after and he was able to collect the 10 millions as hé was first percentage wise.
```

### Precious Gems anywhere?
```
So it was the Precious Gems from Prism then?
```
```
Precious Gems where close to the gas giant. Mestra
