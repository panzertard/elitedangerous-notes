# Ian Ridpath Star Tales

[Star Tales - Andromeda](http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/andromeda.htm)  

Jewel:  [Upsilon Andromedae b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upsilon_Andromedae_b), [Saffar](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Saffar_(planet)&redirect=no)  
Brow:  

Sea monster: Cetus  
siren of the deepest void: Cetus? Triton? Gorgons?  

Parent's grief: [Perseus](http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/perseus.htm)  

Lover's woe: Again [Perseus](http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/perseus.htm)? Or Gorgons/Medusa?
> The brother of Dictys was King Polydectes, who coveted Danaë as a wife. But Danaë was reluctant and Perseus, now grown to manhood, defended her from the king’s advances. Instead, King Polydectes hatched a plan to get rid of Perseus. The king pretended he had turned his attentions to Hippodameia, daughter of King Oenomaus of Elis. King Polydectes asked his subjects, including Perseus, to provide horses for a wedding present. Perseus had no horse to give, nor money to buy one, so Polydectes sent him to bring the head of Medusa the Gorgon. 


**NOTE**: Remember to check the "missing" Van Maanens companion, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Maanen_2>  
> The possibility of a substellar companion remains uncertain. As at 2004 one paper claimed detection of this,[32] and one discounted this.[33] As of 2008, observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope appear to rule out any companions within 1,200 AU of the star that have four Jupiter masses or greater.[34]  

It was linked to the leg in Andromeda? Go back and check.

#### Gorgons  
> three hideously ugly sisters called Euryale, Stheno, and Medusa.  
They were the daughters of Phorcys, a god of the sea, and his sister Ceto

#### Triton  
There is a link to [Triton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triton_(mythology)), when  
> Perseus snatched the eye from them (The Graeae) and threw it into Lake Tritonis.  

**But**. Triton is hardly a whisperer, he is using a horn.  

[Lake Tritonis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tritonis) is named after [Triton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triton_(mythology)).  

> He was the ruler (possessor) of the depths of the sea,[1] who is either "dreadful" or "mighty" (δεινός) according to the epithet given him by Hesiod.

> Triton also had a daughter named Triteia.  

**Triteia** is a system in Elite.  

The stories of Lake Tritonis also involves more vagabonds in the form of the Argonauts.  

> Since they could find no outlet from Lake Tritonis to the sea, they could do nothing. Then they propitiated the deities with a golden tripod on the shore and Triton, the local deity, appeared to them in the form of a youth, to show them a hidden channel to the sea.  

> This late myth related that a lake nymph named Tritonis made the lake her home and, according to an ancient tradition, was the mother of Athena by Poseidon. (Herodotus, iv. 180; Pindar. Pytli. iv. 20.) By Amphithemis, she became the mother of Nasamon and Caphaurus.  

### Triton in fairytales
Some truths or not in other tales?  
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Little_Mermaid_characters#Triton>  
Based on [Hans Crhistian Andersens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_Andersen) work, who's also written _Princess and the Pea_ and other famous stories.  
>  A keen traveller, Andersen published several other long travelogues  

**Traveler** is a strong theme :  Andersen & Argonauts both referring to Triton.  


#### Jewel
> Upsilon Andromedae b (υ Andromedae b, abbreviated Upsilon And b, υ And b), formally named Saffar /ˈsæfɑːr/, is an extrasolar planet approximately 44 light-years away  

Can it be this silly, Saffar is saffire? It really isn't, but FDev have done similar wordplays previously. (see former treasure hunts)
