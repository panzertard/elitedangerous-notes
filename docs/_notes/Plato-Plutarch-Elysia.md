# Allegorical Plato
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegorical_interpretations_of_Plato>  

## Plutarch and the Eleusinian Mysteries
> The routine attribution of hidden meanings to Plato among Middle Platonists can be found, for example, in **[Plutarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch)** (c. 45 – 125 CE), a priest of the [**Elysian** mysteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusinian_Mysteries) and perhaps a Platonic successor

## Elysium  

> In Homer's Odyssey, Elysium is described as a paradise

### Cronus
-	Pindar's Odes describes the reward waiting for those living a righteous life:

		The good receive a life free from toil, not scraping with the strength of their arms the earth, nor the water of the sea, for the sake of a poor sustenance. But in the presence of the honored gods, those who gladly kept their oaths enjoy a life without tears, while the others undergo a toil that is unbearable to look at. Those who have persevered three times, on either side, to keep their souls free from all wrongdoing, follow Zeus' road to the end, to the tower of Cronus, where ocean breezes blow around the island of the blessed, and flowers of gold are blazing, some from splendid trees on land, while water nurtures others. With these wreaths and garlands of flowers they entwine their hands according to the righteous counsels of Rhadamanthys, whom the great father, the husband of Rhea whose throne is above all others, keeps close beside him as his partner
    — Pindar, Odes (2.59–75)  
    
**NOTICE**: CRONUS -> [Elysia](https://eddb.io/system/4539)

### Tartarus
- In Virgil's Aeneid, Aeneas, like Heracles and Odysseus before him, travels to the underworld. Virgil describes those who will travel to Elysium, and those who will travel to Tartarus:  

		Night speeds by, And we, Aeneas, lose it in lamenting. Here comes the place where cleaves our way in twain. Thy road, the right, toward Pluto's dwelling goes, And leads us to Elysium. But the left Speeds sinful souls to doom, and is their path To Tartarus th' accurst.
	— Virgil, Aeneid (6.539)
