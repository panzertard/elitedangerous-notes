# Odysseus

Vagabond [Odysseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odysseus)  
[Sirens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siren_(mythology)), [Scylla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scylla)  

#### Lover's woe?
In John Keats' (Keats' Endymion) loose retelling ...  
>  Glaucus then takes her corpse to a crystal palace at the bottom of the ocean where lie the bodies of all lovers who have died at sea

### Scylla, Hecate 
Many [references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scylla) to [Hecate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecate) being mother of Scylla  

### Hecate
"goddess of witchcraft"  
> the witch Erichtho invokes Hecate as "**Persephone**, who is the third and lowest aspect of **Hecate**, the goddess we witches revere"  

> **Like Hecate,** "[t]he dog is a creature of the threshold, the guardian of doors and portals, and so it is appropriately associated with the frontier between life and death, and with demons and ghosts which move across the frontier. The yawning gates of Hades were guarded by the monstrous watchdog Cerberus, whose function was to prevent the living from entering the underworld, and the dead from leaving it."
