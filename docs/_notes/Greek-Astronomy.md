## Interpretation of instructions
**Part 1** - Instructions on how to interpret as well as rough location.  
Assumption: Andromeda  
> "To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!  

Andromeda, again, which is **Classical Greek Astronomy**.  

**Part 2** - What kind of mythology & pieces to follow, perhaps which system to look in :  
> To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void!   

Meaning Sirens(?) via the "_Myth of Er_", but is the link strong enough?  
I'm not so sure about this.  

**Part 3** - Where in the system to go :  
> The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts. To Raxxla!"  

### Conjectures and possible references
Part 1: Andromeda, Big Dipper, Ursa Major, Ursa Minor  
Part 2: Sirens as depicted in the [Myth of Er](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_Er)  
Part 3: 
- Parent's grief: _________ TBD _______
- Lover's woe: __________ TBD _______
- Vagabond = Wanderer(?), which is a term in [classical Greek astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_astronomy) which refer to **planets**.  

Finally we need to figure out which model to use to predict where in the system the planet is.  
If it is a planet that is...

## Archaic Greek astronomy

No reference: Hesiod  
[Homer, Ports and outposts](https://www.edsm.net/en/search/stations/index/name/Homer/sortBy/distanceSol)  
[Gilgamesh](https://eddb.io/system/5215) system

> Homer has several astronomical phenomena including solar eclipses. In the Iliad and the Odyssey, Homer refers to the following celestial objects:  
    - the constellation Boötes  
    - the star cluster Hyades  
    - the constellation Orion  
    - the star cluster Pleiades  
    - Sirius, the Dog Star  
    - the constellation Ursa Major  

No reference: Anaximander, Philolaus, Antichthon
> **Pythagorean** described a **cosmos with the stars, planets, Sun, Moon, Earth, and a counter-Earth** (Antichthon)—**ten bodies** in all—circling an unseen central fire  

[Pythagoras, Ports and outposts](https://www.edsm.net/en/search/stations/index/name/Pythagoras/sortBy/distanceSol)  

> a more detailed description about the cosmos, Stars, Sun, Moon and the Earth can be found in the **[Orphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphism_(religion))**  
Note:  
> Orphics revered Dionysus or Bacchus (who once descended into the Underworld and returned) and **Persephone** (who annually descended into the Underworld for a season and then returned).  
Note: Very little in common otherwise.  

#### The Planets in Early Greek Astronomy
> The name "planet" comes from the Greek term πλανήτης (planētēs), meaning "**wanderer**", as ancient astronomers noted how certain lights moved across the sky in relation to the other stars. Five extraterrestrial planets can be seen with the naked eye: **Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn**, the Greek names being **Hermes, Aphrodite, Ares, Zeus and Cronus**. Sometimes the luminaries, the **Sun and Moon**, are added to the list of naked eye planets to make a total of **seven**.

## Eudoxan astronomy
> In classical Greece, astronomy was a branch of mathematics; astronomers sought to create geometrical models that could imitate the appearances of celestial motions. This tradition began with the **Pythagoreans**, who placed astronomy among the four mathematical arts (along with arithmetic, geometry, and music). The study of number comprising the four arts was later called the _Quadrivium_.  

[Pythagoras, Ports and outposts](https://www.edsm.net/en/search/stations/index/name/Pythagoras/sortBy/distanceSol)  

> **Plato** (427–347 BC) included the quadrivium as the basis for philosophical education in the Republic. He encouraged a younger mathematician, **Eudoxus** of Cnidus (c. 410 BC–c. 347 BC), to develop a system of Greek astronomy  

No reference: Plato  
[Eudoxus, Ports and outposts](https://www.edsm.net/en/search/stations/index/name/Eudoxus/sortBy/distanceSol)  Note: Kuk  

> Plato's main books on cosmology are the Timaeus and the Republic. In them he described the two-sphere model and said there were eight circles or spheres carrying the seven planets and the fixed stars.  
According to the **"Myth of Er"** in the Republic, the cosmos is the Spindle of Necessity, attended by **Sirens** and spun by the three daughters of the Goddess Necessity known collectively as the **Moirai or Fates**.  

[Moirai](https://eddb.io/system/13776) system  
[Fates](https://eddb.io/system/4753) system  
**Note:** _Myth of Er_ could be more plausible if Plato had more references.  

> According to a story reported by Simplicius of Cilicia (6th century), **Plato** posed a question for the Greek mathematicians of his day: "By the assumption of what uniform and orderly motions can the apparent motions of the planets be accounted for?" (quoted in Lloyd 1970, p. 84). **Plato** proposed that the **seemingly chaotic wandering motions of the planets could be explained** by combinations of uniform circular motions centered on a spherical Earth, apparently a novel idea in the 4th century.  

> **Eudoxus** rose to the challenge by assigning to each planet a set of concentric spheres. By tilting the axes of the spheres, and by assigning each a different period of revolution, he was able to approximate the celestial "appearances." Thus, he was the first to attempt a mathematical description of the motions of the planets.  
> A general idea of the content of On Speeds, his book on the planets, can be gleaned from **Aristotle**'s Metaphysics

## Astronomy in the Greco-Roman and Late Antique eras

> **Hipparchus** is considered to have been among the most important Greek astronomers, because he introduced the concept of exact prediction into astronomy. He was also the last innovative astronomer before Claudius **Ptolemy**, a mathematician who worked at Alexandria in Roman Egypt in the 2nd century. Ptolemy's works on astronomy and astrology include the Almagest, the Planetary Hypotheses, and the Tetrabiblos, as well as the Handy Tables, the Canobic Inscription, and other minor works. 

[Ptolemy](https://eddb.io/system/439212) system. Note: same region as Aristarchus and Hipparchus system.  

### Ptolemaic astronomy
> The **[Almagest](Sirius-Colonisation)** is one of the most influential books in the history of Western astronomy. In this book, Ptolemy explained how to predict the behavior of the planets  

[Almagest](https://eddb.io/system/24460) system  
[Sirius-Almagest](Sirius-Colonisation) connection.  

> Ptolemy explained how to predict the behavior of the planets, as Hipparchus could not, with the introduction of a new mathematical tool, the [equant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equant).  

> Ptolemy placed the planets in the order that would remain standard until it was displaced by the heliocentric system and the Tychonic system:  
    1. Moon  
    2. Mercury  
    3. Venus  
    4. Sun  
    5. Mars  
    6. Jupiter  
    7. Saturn  
    8. Fixed stars

## Contextual references

#### Vagabond, Wanderer
>  In Classical Greece, the **"wandering stars"** and the gods who directed them were separate entities, as for Plato; in Hellenistic culture, the association became an inseparable identification, so that Apollo, no longer the regent of the Sun, actually was Helios (Seznec 1981, pp 37–40).  

#### Almagest: Ref Sirius + Andromeda
1. Sirius is present here with a station, Sirius Reach.  
2. Almagest was ['missing' due to a bug](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/almagest-and-sirius-reach-station-missing-mystery-investigation.276483/) at one stage and showed up as `WREDGUIA XD-K D8-78`.  
> One of the systems which were selected for editing following the **Sirius Corp colonization CG**.  

Further [reminder](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-7819691):  
> Sirius the dog star ... Hecates favorite animal. Also its been so long I had forgotten about [The Grand Sirius Interstellar Expedition](https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/23-FEB-3301) back in 3301.... which had us turning in exploration data and ended up in the wonders of Robigo Sothis and Ceos. Both Robigo and Sothis are gods similar to Hecate and related to Sirius. Ceos was a greek Island where they worshiped the star Sirius

# Other weak references
Leaving these references here for later. This is how I started looking into the Hellenistic culture and traditional Greek Astronomy.  
[Ursa Major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major) and [Greco-Roman tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major#Greco-Roman_tradition) links to Callisto  
> ... Jupiter turns **Arcas** into a bear too and puts them both in the sky, forming Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. **Callisto** is Ursa Major and her son, Arcas, is Ursa Minor. An alternate version has **Arcas become the constellation Boötes**.  

[Arcas](https://eddb.io/system/bodies/1236) planet  

[Big Dipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dipper) references Callisto  
> **Classical Greek mythography** identified the "Bear" as the nymph **Callisto**

### Callisto
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callisto_(mythology)>  
> The myth in **Catasterismi** may be derived from the fact that a set of constellations appear close together in the sky, in and near the Zodiac sign of Libra, namely Ursa Minor, Ursa Major, Boötes, and Virgo. The constellation Boötes, was explicitly identified in the Hesiodic Astronomia (Ἀστρονομία)[16] as Arcas, the "Bear-warden" (Arktophylax; Ἀρκτοφύλαξ):[17]  

#### Catasterismi
> Catasterismi (Greek Καταστερισμοί Katasterismoi, "placings among the stars") is an Alexandrian prose retelling of the mythic **origins of stars and constellations**, as they were interpreted in **Hellenistic culture**.
