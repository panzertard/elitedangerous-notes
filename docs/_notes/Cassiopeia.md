# Cassiopeia
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_%28constellation%29>  
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_(mother_of_Andromeda)>  

> Cassiopeia, the queen of Aethiopia. Cassiopeia was the wife of King Cepheus of Aethiopia and mother of **Princess Andromeda**. Cepheus and Cassiopeia were placed next to each other among the stars, along with Andromeda.  

> In the ancient Celtic world Anu was the mother goddess and considered to be the mother of all the gods; the Tuatha de Danann. Other references say that she is the mother earth goddess or the Goddess of fertility. On the Cork Kerry border are two mountains called the Paps of Anu (pap is another word for breast.) On the top of each mountain are stone structures or cairns that when viewed from a distance make the two mountains look like a pair of breasts. Anu was known, in the Celtic World, by several similar names: **Danu or Don** being the most popular alternatives. She was a Mother-Goddess, the wife of the Sun God, Belenos, and considered to be the ancestor of all the Gods, the Tuatha dé Danann, who found themselves obliged to reside in the Otherworld when Miled brought the Celts to the British Isles. She still looks down on us from the night's sky where she appears as Llys Don, better known as the constellation of Casseopeia

> the Lapps, for whom the W of Cassiopeia forms an elk antler. The **Chukchi** (nomads) of Siberia similarly saw the five main stars as five reindeer stags

#### (I shall not forget to check Danu)
* Note, I've now done so and I didn't find anything remarkable.

## The remnant A Cassiopeiae
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_A>  
> it is possible that it was recorded as a sixth magnitude star 3 Cassiopeiae  
The designations Cassiopeia X-1, Cas XR-1, Cas X-1 are no longer used, but the X-ray source is Cas A (SNR G111.7-02.1) at 2U 2321+58

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Cassiopeiae>  
> Caroline Herschel noted that a star in the vicinity of τ Cas, HD 220562, fitted well with 3 Cas if a common error in sextant readings was made

## The remnant B Cassiopeiae

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1572>
> SN 1572 (Tycho's Supernova, Tycho's Nova), or B Cassiopeiae (B Cas), was a supernova of Type Ia in the constellation Cassiopeia, one of eight supernovae visible to the naked eye in historical records  

[Tycho](https://eddb.io/system/427559) system, near 
Also see the Greek-Astronomy table: [Greek-Astronomy](./Greek-Astronomy#Sizable references)
Notice the nearby big names of Greek-Astronomy references.  

> In Gaia DR2, the star was calculated to be **6400+2000
−1200** light-years away, on the lower end of SN 1572's possible range of distances  

> SN 1572, traditionally known as Tycho's Star, appeared about 5 degrees to the northwest of **Caph** in 1572

### Nature, Princess Astrophil 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)
> In 2007 **Nature (together with Science)** received the **Prince of Asturias Award** for Communications and Humanity.  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_of_Asturias_Awards>
> The **Princess of Asturias Awards**[1] (Spanish: Premios Princesa de Asturias, Asturian: Premios Princesa d'Asturies), **formerly** the Prince of Asturias Awards from 1981 to 2014 (Spanish: Premios Príncipe de Asturias), are a series of annual prizes awarded in Spain by the Princess of Asturias Foundation (previously the Prince of Asturias Foundation) to individuals, entities or organizations from around the world


### Other litterature
> The supernova inspired the poem "Al Aaraaf" by Edgar Allan Poe.  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Aaraaf>  

> Poe identified the supernova with Al Aaraaf, a star that was the **place between paradise and hell**. Al Aaraaf (Arabic الأعراف, alternatively transliterated al-Aʻrāf) was a place where people who have been neither markedly good nor markedly bad had to stay until forgiven by God and let into Paradise

> Poe also drew upon the Quran in other works, including **"The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Scheherazade"**  
Poe was probably less interested in the Quran itself and more interested in an atmosphere of the exotic or otherworldliness.[10] The true setting of the poem is a sort of **dreamscape or alternative world**.

> In the opening section of the poem, God commands Nesace, a name for Beauty's spirit, to convey a message to "**other worlds**". Nesace rouses the angel Ligeia and tells her to awaken the other thousand seraphs to perform God's work. Two souls, however, fail to respond: the "maiden-angel" Ianthe and her "seraph-lover" Angelo (Michelangelo), who describes his death on earth and the flight of his spirit to Al Aaraaf. Ianthe and Angelo are **lovers**, and their failure to do as Nesace commanded results in God not allowing them into heaven.  

### Whisperer?
> Poe read "Al Aaraaf", renamed **"The Messenger Star"** for the event, ...  

### Famous stories
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thousand-and-Second_Tale_of_Scheherazade>  
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_works_influenced_by_One_Thousand_and_One_Nights>  
> The influence of the versions of **The Nights on world literature is immense**. Writers as diverse as Henry Fielding and Naguib Mahfouz have alluded to the work by name in their own literature. Other writers who have been influenced by the Nights include John Barth, Jorge Luis Borges, Salman Rushdie, Goethe, Walter Scott, Letitia Elizabeth Landon, Thackeray, Wilkie Collins, Elizabeth Gaskell, Nodier, Flaubert, Marcel Schwob, Stendhal, Dumas, Gérard de Nerval, Gobineau, Pushkin, Tolstoy, Hofmannsthal, Conan Doyle, W. B. Yeats, H. G. Wells, Cavafy, Calvino, Georges Perec, H. P. Lovecraft, Marcel Proust, A. S. Byatt, Ruydard Kipling and Angela Carter.[1]

### Other
> "Al Aaraaf" was used between 1928 and 1952 as a pen name by Glasgow artist Hannah Frank.  

# Carthage

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Carthage>

> According to Roman sources, Phoenician colonists from modern-day Lebanon, led by **Dido** (also known as Queen **Elissa**), founded Carthage c. 814 BC.[9] Queen Elissa (also known as "Alissar") was allegedly an exiled **princess** of the ancient Phoenician city of Tyre. At its peak, the metropolis she founded, Carthage, came to be called the **"shining city"**  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dido>
> Many names in the legend of **Dido** are of Punic origin, which suggests that the first Greek authors who mention this story have taken up Phoenician accounts. One suggestion is that Dido is an epithet from the same Semitic root as David, which means "**Beloved**".[2] Others state Didô means "**the wanderer**"

> Carthage under the Phoenicians was accused by its adversaries of **child sacrifice**. Plutarch (20:14,4–6) alleges the practice  

> Virgil's Roman epic, the **Aeneid**, first introduces Queen Dido (the Greek name for Elissa) as a highly esteemed character

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneid>

> The Aeneid (/ɪˈniːɪd/ ih-NEE-id; Latin: Aeneis [ae̯ˈneːɪs]) is a Latin epic poem, written by Virgil between 29 and 19 BC,[1] that tells the legendary story of **Aeneas**, a **Trojan** who travelled to Italy, where he became the ancestor of the Romans. It comprises 9,896 lines in **dactylic hexameter**.  

Note: You better understand why `dactylic hexameter` is important.  
Note: Check `Aeneas` system  
Note: Don't forget `Trojan` and `Between` in the `Eta Cassiopeiae` system (the star, twins?)
