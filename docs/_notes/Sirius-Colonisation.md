## Looking for a pattern how Sirius colonised in the early days
<https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/23-FEB-3301>

> Inspired by Universal Cartographics recent push to expand humanities borders, the Sirius Corporation has today announced its plan to launch a number of new colonial outposts to the very edges of occupied space.  

> Ana Quin, Sirius' Junior Vice President of Interstellar Logistics, had this to say about the announcement:  
_"We're very excited to move forward with this project. It's been a long time coming, but finally the board have agreed it's time to get the ball rolling. We've got the tech and the volunteers, all we need now is to know where to send them."_  

> Sirius is currently offering sizeable monetary rewards for explorers who bring usable exploration data containing potential candidate sites to their offices aboard Nourse Orbital in **Lambda Andromedae**

> Te Kaha, HIP 8396, Takurua, Almagest, Robigo, Ceos, Sothis. all founded by sirius corporation  

The question is the whole lineup of Sirius funded systems. 



<https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/12-MAR-3301>
> The 9 systems chosen to act as new homes to Sirius Corporation colonists are:  

**The Wredguia Colony Cluster**  
1. Wredquia SX-L d7-92  (Still Wredguia SX-L d7-92 ??) - **note**, spelling error in Original Galnet article `Wred**q**uia`
1. Wredguia SX-L d7-91  (Sothis)  
1. Wredguia WD-K D8-66  (Ceos)  
1. Wredguia QA-N b34-4  (Robigo)  
1. Wredguia XD-K d8-78  (Almagest)  

**Sirius Outposts**  
1. Gliese 97.2 (Takurua)
1. HIP 8396  
1. Col 285 Sector WA-L b9-3 (Te Kaha) 
1. CAO Junga

**Question**: So why did nothing change for `Wredguia SX-L d7-92`?
